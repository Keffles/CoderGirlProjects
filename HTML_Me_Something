    <blockquote>
      <p><i>â€œRosa Parks was of the purest personification of strength. She lived a life clothed in meekness and genteel humility. Though she never bore children, her deep love for them made each of us stronger by her example of self-respect and righteous indignation. She remained seated so that all, everywhere, might standâ€¦taller.â€</i><b> -Angela Bassett</b></p>
